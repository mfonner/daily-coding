My solutions for dailycodingproblem.com challenges.

 These might not be the most elegant solutions, but they are good exercises for learning new libraries, packages, and just new and different ways to accomplish tasks.

### auto_complete
Implement an autocomplete system. 
That is, given a query string s and a set of all possible query strings, 
return all strings in the set that have s as a prefix.

### job_scheduler
Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function f and an integer n, 
and calls f after n milliseconds.

### list_comprehensions
Given a list of numbers and a number, k, return whether any two numbers from
the list provided add up to k.

### logging
You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log.
Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

    record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log

    get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log.
        i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

'''
You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last N order ids in a log. 
Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log

get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. 
    i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.
